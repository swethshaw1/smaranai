open VS Code
then open this directory on VS Code
go to terminal then type cd frontend you'll move to frontend directory 
then create one more terminal ( + option) then type cd backend you'll move to backend directory. 
Then in the frontend terminal type npm run dev 
and in backend type npx nodemon 
then there will be a link shown in the frontend terminal 
just copy that and paste it in the browser

# Download and install fnm:
winget install Schniz.fnm

# Download and install Node.js:
fnm install 22

# Verify the Node.js version:
node -v # Should print "v22.13.1".

# Verify npm version:
npm -v # Should print "10.9.2".
